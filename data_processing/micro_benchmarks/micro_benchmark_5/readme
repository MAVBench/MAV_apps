purpose: measure the impact of  point cloud's point count on octomap performance
intentend behavior: drone lifting up and flying toward an obstacle (as the drone's FOV is occluded more and more, the number of points in the PC decreases)

map:simple_map_20_20_closer_start_player

how to run: 
  # fly and collect performance measurements 
  ./script_1.bash
