purpose: measure the impact of  map volume on octomap perforamnce. Note that you can measure the impact of any parameter on the octomap with this benchmark
intentend behavior: drone lifting up and flying for 100 second
note that we have collected data for different resolutions (one and two resolutions and same point cloud)

map: simple_map_00

how to run: 
  # fly and collect performance measurements
  ./script_1.bash
