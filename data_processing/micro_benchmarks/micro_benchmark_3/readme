purpose: calculate the map difference for difference point cloud resolutions (quantifying the impact of point cloud resolutiong mapping on octomap. In other words, what is the acceptable resolution
for point cloud relative to octomap)
intentend behavior: drone lifting up and flying for a little while 

map: _octomap_side_view

how to run: 
  # get a map with some param configuration (say point cloud resolution of .3)
  ./script_1.bash
  ./script_2.bash (in a different terminal)
  cp ~/.ros/high_res_map.ot to some directory

  # get another map with some param configuration (say point cloud resolution of .3)
  ./script_1.bash
  ./script_2.bash (in a different terminal)
  cp ~/.ros/high_res_map.ot (to some directory with different name)


  # compare the maps
  # set the maps names in compare_octomaps.launch
  # set the comparison mode (can pick from volume based and kld based)
  # compare the two with the following command 
  roslaunch compare_octomaps compare_octomaps.launch
