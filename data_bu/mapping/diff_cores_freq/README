set_1 
    done with resolution of .3 
    time_out_ctr was 20
    velocities the same (3.84)


set_2 done with resolution of .15
    time_out_ctr was 5
    velocities the same (3.84)

set_3 done with resolution of .15
    time_out_ctr was 5
    the map is smaller now to accomodate the long time execution of lower operating points
    velocities the same (3.84)

set_4 done with resolution of .15
    time_out_ctr was 5
    the map is smaller now to accomodate the long time execution of lower operating points
    velocities are tunned according to the image to follow time
	NOTe: the issue was threshold, so dismiss the data

diff_velocity done with resolution of .15
    time_out_ctr was 5
    the map is smaller now to accomodate the long time execution of lower operating points
    velocities are tunned according to the image to follow time
    fixed the issue in diff_velocity
