purpose: measuring the impact of time budget (for planning) and map resolution on planning. Basically, 
we expect that for higher map resolutions, we need to dedicate more time budget for planning because  casting ray takes longer in a higher resolution map.
In this experiment, we have varied the map resolution and planning budget. 

map: simple_map_20_20

How to run: use the profiling scripts

Quantifying the results:
    We quanitify the impact by measuring the piecewise_planning and smooothening failure rate.
    we also quantify the path quality by measuring the normalized path length (i.e., RRT generated path/direct path)
    we can also quantify the path quality by looking at the distance travelled. We see an intersting trend. 

    data1: was collected with two resolutions simaltensously carried in octomap
    data2: was collected with one resolution. collected the path length 


    In both above data, planner takes the lower resolution.
